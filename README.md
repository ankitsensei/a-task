# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

## Task Management and Productivity Tracker
Problem Statement:
Many people struggle with managing their daily tasks, tracking habits, and maintaining productivity. Build a tool to help users organize tasks and monitor productivity effectively.

### Features:

Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Mark tasks as completed or pending.
Categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal, Study).

ðŸ‘‰Habit Tracker:
Track daily/weekly habits like exercise, reading, or coding.
Show progress with visual indicators (e.g., streaks, completion percentage).

ðŸ‘‰Pomodoro Timer:
Built-in timer to focus on tasks using the Pomodoro technique.
Display session history for tracking focus times.

ðŸ‘‰Responsive Design:
Optimized for both desktop and mobile views using Tailwind CSS.

ðŸ‘‰Local Storage:
Save user data (tasks and progress) in the browser's local storage for persistence.

ðŸ‘‰Dark Mode Toggle:
Allow users to switch between light and dark modes for better usability.

## Tech Stack:
ðŸ‘‰Frontend: React
ðŸ‘‰Styling: Tailwind CSS
ðŸ‘‰State Management: React Context or useReducer
ðŸ‘‰Storage: LocalStorage (no backend required, unless you want to expand later)

## Bonus Features (Optional):
ðŸ‘‰Authentication (with Firebase or Supabase): Allow users to log in and sync their data across devices.

ðŸ‘‰Progress Dashboard:
Visualize completed tasks and habits using charts (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts).
Priority System: Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to tasks and sort them accordingly.

ðŸ‘‰Why This Program?
Solves a real problem (task management and productivity).
Practical and easy to scale.
Uses intermediate React concepts like state management, hooks, and component composition.
Allows creative use of Tailwind for responsive and aesthetic design.
